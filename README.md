# FD2D
Two dimensional finite difference code for non-Newtonian convection.

Developed by Dr Jack King, University of Manchester.

Solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in vorticity streamfunction form using 8th order central finite differences for explicit convective and diffusive terms. Second order central differences are used for compressibility constraint, which is solved by successive over relaxation (SOR).
